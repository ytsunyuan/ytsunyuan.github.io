Welcome to Yuan Sun's homepage!

I am currently an Associate Professor in the [School of Electronic Engineering](https://see.bupt.edu.cn/) at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/). 

Before joining BUPT, I received the B.E. degree from the [School of Instrumentation Science and OptoElectronics Engineering](http://yqgdxy.buaa.edu.cn/index.jsp), [Beihang University](https://buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from the [School of Electronic and Information Engineering](http://www.ee.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University](https://buaa.edu.cn/), in 2016.


My primary research interests include global navigation satellite system positioning, integrity monitoring, and their applications in aviation and autonomous vehicle.
